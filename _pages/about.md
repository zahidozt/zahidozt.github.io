I'm a third year Ph.D. Student at Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering [(ECE)](https://ece.umd.edu/), University of Maryland, College Park [(UMD)](https://umd.edu/), working under the supervision of [K. J. Ray Liu](http://www.cspl.umd.edu/kjrliu/), at [Signals and Information Group (SIG)](http://sig.umd.edu/).

My research interests include wireless sensing and signal processing. Specifically, I work on projects that use 2.4/5/60 GHz WiFi/Radar devices for different sensing applications, including human monitoring (e.g. breathing, gait), and environment monitoring (e.g. sound, motion).

Prior to that, I received my B.Sc. degree from the [Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering](https://ee.boun.edu.tr/), [Bogazici University](http://boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index), Istanbul, Turkey.

# Teaching
I have been a TA for ENEE322: Signals and Systems, and ENEE408G: Multimedia Signal Processing during the academic year 2018-2019, received Outstanding TA award from the Department of ECE, and George Corcoran Memorial Award for teaching.

# Other
I like to be a part of volunteering organizations, and help people. Recently, a couple of friends and I have started an organization called [ONGOR](https://www.oncugonuller.com/) (available in Turkish) to help other international students on getting into PhD programs. We have also partnered with another program, [Fatima Fellowship](http://fatimafellowship.com/), to provide a means for international research collaboration, in computer science and social sciences. Feel free to reach out to me, if you'd like to learn more!
