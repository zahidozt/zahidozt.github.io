I'm a third year PhD Student at Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering [(ECE)](https://ece.umd.edu/), University of Maryland, College Park [(UMD)](https://umd.edu/), working under the supervision of [K. J. Ray Liu](http://www.cspl.umd.edu/kjrliu/), at [Signals and Information Group (SIG)](http://sig.umd.edu/).
My research interests include wireless sensing and signal processing. Specifically, I work on projects that use 2.4/5/60 GHz WiFi/Radar devices for different sensing applications, including human monitoring (e.g. breathing, gait), and environment monitoring (e.g. sound, motion).
Prior to that, I received my B.S degree from the [Department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering](https://ee.boun.edu.tr/), [Bogazici University](http://boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index), Istanbul, Turkey.
