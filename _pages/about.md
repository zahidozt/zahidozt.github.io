<<<<<<< HEAD
I'm currently a principal scientist at [Origin Wireless AI](https://www.originwirelessai.com/),
building real-world Wi-Fi sensing products.
I received my Ph.D. in 2022 from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at University of Maryland, College Park. 
During my PhD. I worked under the supervision of [K. J. Ray Liu](http://www.cspl.umd.edu/kjrliu/), at [Signals and Information Group (SIG)](http://sig.umd.edu/).

I specialize in developing and applying AI tools to create practical, high-performance, and user-friendly products.
My expertise lies in building wireless sensing systems that use deep learning 
and signal processing, enabling billions of Wi-Fi connected devices to function as powerful 
sensing tools.  With this, smart home applications such as whole home security and advanced 
health monitoring are made possible. Check out the following video for our most recent product, [TruShield](https://www.originwirelessai.com/trushield/):

Beyond Wi-Fi sensing, my research also explores multimodal sensing with millimeter-wave radar 
for applications in human and environment monitoring. I have developed 
systems using commercial-of-the-shelf devices and created proof-of-concept demos that 
enable next-generation sound sensing applications. You can find a demo in the following video:

I'm a Ph.D. Candidate at Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering [(ECE)](https://ece.umd.edu/), University of Maryland, College Park [(UMD)](https://umd.edu/), working under the supervision of [K. J. Ray Liu](http://www.cspl.umd.edu/kjrliu/), at [Signals and Information Group (SIG)](http://sig.umd.edu/).

My research interests include wireless sensing and signal processing, where our projects are usually end-to-end systems with classical signal processing front-end, combined with deep learning. Specifically, I work on projects that use 2.4/5/60/77 GHz Wi-Fi and Radar devices for different sensing applications, including human monitoring (e.g. breathing, gait) and environment monitoring (e.g. sound, vibration). My recent work focuses on sensing sound and related applications using mmWave radars. We have initially explored sensing sound from daily objects (ICASSP 2021) and speaker surfaces. More recently, we have proposed a multimodal system that combines audio and radio modalities for speech enhancement and separation (ICASSP 2022).

# Other
I like to help people academically on a volunteering basis. Recently, a couple of friends and I have started an organization called [ONGOR](https://www.oncugonuller.com/) (available in Turkish) to help other international students on getting into the PhD programs. We have also partnered with another program, [Fatima Fellowship](http://fatimafellowship.com/), to provide a means for international research collaboration in computer science and social sciences. If you'd like to learn more, feel free to reach out to me!
