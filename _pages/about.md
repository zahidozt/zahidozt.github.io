I'm a Principal Scientist at [Origin Wireless AI](https://www.originwirelessai.com/). I received my Ph.D. in 2022 from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering [(ECE)](https://ece.umd.edu/) at University of Maryland, College Park [(UMD)](https://umd.edu/). During my PhD. I worked under the supervision of [K. J. Ray Liu](http://www.cspl.umd.edu/kjrliu/), at [Signals and Information Group (SIG)](http://sig.umd.edu/).

My research interests include wireless sensing and signal processing, where our projects are usually end-to-end systems with classical signal processing front-end, combined with deep learning. Specifically, I work on projects that use 2.4/5/60/77 GHz Wi-Fi and Radar devices for different sensing applications, including human monitoring (e.g. breathing, gait) and environment monitoring (e.g. sound, vibration). My recent work focuses on sensing sound and related applications using mmWave radars. We have initially explored sensing sound from daily objects (ICASSP 2021, IEEE IoTJ) and speaker surfaces. More recently, we have proposed a multimodal system that combines audio and radio modalities for speech enhancement and separation (ICASSP 2022, IEEE/ACM TASLP 2023).

Currently, as a principal scientist, I develop signal processing and machine learning algorithms to solve practical problems in Wi-Fi sensing. My expertise spans from developing preprocessing and filtering algorithms to render CSI measurements suitable for sensing tasks, to building large scale machine learning models. I conduct cutting-edge research, develop proof-of-concept demos, design data collection experiments, craft measurement methods and get involved with real-time implementation of algoritms. I also contribute to UI/UX aspect of our systems, especially those involve user training, and product development efforts.

Prior to my Ph.D., I received my B.S. degree from the [Department of Electrical &amp; Electronics Engineering](https://ee.boun.edu.tr/), [Bogazici University](http://boun.edu.tr/en-US/Index), Istanbul, Turkey.
